## ✨ Why NEO-WZML

NEO-WZML is built for people who move a lot of files through Telegram and cloud storage. It combines the classic mirror/leech workflow with modern file selection, persistent user settings, strong queue controls, and practical media tools.

- 🔌 **One bot, many sources:** direct links, torrents, Mega, TeraBox, Google Drive, JDownloader, yt-dlp, Telegram messages, and rclone remotes.
- 🎯 **Multiple upload targets:** Telegram leech, Google Drive, TeraBox, rclone remotes, GoFile, BuzzHeavier, and PixelDrain.
- 🌐 **Web file selection:** pick torrent files, Mega folder files, rclone folder files, and TeraBox account files before downloading.
- 🎬 **Media-ready:** split, convert, merge videos, sample videos, screenshots, metadata, thumbnails, and custom FFmpeg pipelines.
- 🗜️ **Archive workflow:** extract, password-protected ZIPs, image-only ZIPs, split archive handling, and 7z-backed progress.
- 🛡️ **Operational controls:** MongoDB persistence, queues, per-user limits, cooldowns, verification, auth gates, and safe group behavior.
- 🐳 **Docker-first deployment:** Compose setup with optional Gluetun scaffolding for VPN-routed torrent traffic.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irisXDR/NEO-WZML.git
cd NEO-WZML

cp sample_config.py config.py
# Edit config.py and set the required values listed below.

docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

Stop the stack:

```bash
docker compose down
```

#### Build And Run The Docker Image Using Official Docker Commands

- Start Docker daemon (SKIP if already running, mostly you don't need to do this):

```
sudo dockerd
```

- Build Docker image:

```
sudo docker build . -t wzmlx
```

- Run the image:

```
sudo docker run -p 80:80 -p 8080:8080 wzmlx
```

- To stop the running image:

```
sudo docker ps
```

```
sudo docker stop id
```

### 🔑 Required Configuration

Create `config.py` from `sample_config.py` and set these first:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token from BotFather |
| `OWNER_ID` | Telegram numeric user id of the owner |
| `TELEGRAM_API` | API id from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) |
| `TELEGRAM_HASH` | API hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | MongoDB connection string |

Recommended for the full experience:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `BASE_URL` | Public URL for torrent, Mega, rclone, and TeraBox web file selection |
| `RCLONE_PATH` or `GDRIVE_ID` | Default cloud upload destination |
| `LEECH_DUMP_CHAT` | Default Telegram leech destination |
| `MEGA_EMAIL` / `MEGA_PASSWORD` | Optional Mega account for better Mega workflows |
| `TERABOX_ENABLED` | Enable TeraBox integration (default: `True`) |
| `DEFAULT_UPLOAD` | Default upload cycling: `rc` → `gd` → `tbx` (TeraBox) |

> 🔐 Keep tokens, OAuth files, MongoDB URLs, rclone configs, Mega accounts, TeraBox cookies, and service-account JSONs out of public commits.

## 🧭 Deployment Notes

- 🌐 Port `880` serves the FastAPI web UI, file selector, and qBittorrent proxy.
- 🔗 Port `8880` is used for `rclone serve` when configured.
- 🛡️ `docker-compose.yml` includes an optional Gluetun VPN scaffold for torrent traffic.
- 🍃 MongoDB is required for persistent settings, user data, and task metadata.
- 🧾 `sample_config.py` is the source of truth for advanced configuration.
- ⚙️ `update.py` supports a small environment-variable override allow-list for container deployments.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### 💥 Bot exits at startup

- Confirm `BOT_TOKEN`, `OWNER_ID`, `TELEGRAM_API`, `TELEGRAM_HASH`, and `DATABASE_URL`.
- Check `log.txt` for the first stack trace.
- If using Mongo Atlas, allow-list the server or container egress IP.

### 🌐 File selector does not open

- Set `BASE_URL` to a public URL reachable from your browser.
- Publish port `880` or put it behind a reverse proxy.
- If pincode validation is confusing during setup, temporarily disable `WEB_PINCODE`.

### ☁️ Google Drive tasks fail

- Confirm `token.pickle` or service-account JSONs are valid.
- Make sure the upload destination exists and the auth principal has access.
- Drive API quota errors are usually temporary; retry after the quota window resets.

### 🧲 Torrents stall

- Check tracker reachability from inside the container.
- Use the qBittorrent web proxy on port `880` to inspect live state.
- Configure Gluetun if your host or ISP blocks torrent traffic.
